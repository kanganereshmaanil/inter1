 <h1>5.difference between block and inline </h1>      
# A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
 # An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
 This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
